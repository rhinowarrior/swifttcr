# SwiftTCR

## Overview
**SwiftTCR** is a powerful tool designed to predict bindings between T-cell receptors (TCR) and peptide-MHC complexes.

## Features
- Predict binding interactions between TCRs and peptide-MHC.
- User-friendly command-line interface.
- Efficient clustering algorithms for data analysis.

## Getting Started

To get started with SwiftTCR, follow these steps:

1. **Clone or Download** this repository.
2. Navigate into the SwiftTCR folder.

### Running SwiftTCR
Use the following command to execute SwiftTCR:

```bash
python3 scripts/swift_tcr.py -r /your/input/peptide-mhc -l /your/input/tcr -o output_directory -op output_prefix -c number_of_cores -t clustering_threshold (default=9)
```
<br />

**Example command:**
```bash
python3 scripts/swift_tcr.py -r example/input/benchmark_dataset/3w0w/3w0w_pmhc_renumbered.pdb -l example/input/benchmark_dataset/3w0w/3w0w_tcr.pdb -o example/output/ -op first_test -c 6 -t 9
```

## Dependencies:
* Python 3.9.12 and python 2.7

## Output Structure Naming Convention

### Peptide-MHC Chains
- **A** = MHC (Not IMGT numbered)
- **B** = Î²2m (Not IMGT numbered)
- **C** = Peptide (Not IMGT numbered)

### TCR Chains
- **D** = TCR Alpha Chain (IMGT numbered)
- **E** = TCR Beta Chain (IMGT numbered)

# Installing Python 2.7 and Python 3.12.9 in a Conda Environment

Because of `prepare.py`, this program requires both Python 2.7 and Python 3.12.9. Follow these steps to install and configure both versions.

## Step-by-Step Installation Guide

### 1. Install Conda (if not already installed)

If you don't have Conda installed, you can download and install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

### 2. Create a Conda Environment for Python 3.12.9

Run the following command to create a new Conda environment named `swifttcr` with Python 3.12.9:

conda create -n swifttcr python=3.12.9

### 3. Activate the Conda Environment

Activate the newly created environment:

```bash
conda activate swifttcr
```

### 4. Install Required Packages

Install any required packages for your project within this environment. For example, if you need `numpy` and `pandas`, you can do so with:

```bash
conda install numpy pandas
```

### 5. Install Python 2.7

To install Python 2.7, you can use the following commands:

#### 5.1. Download Python 2.7

Run this command to download the Python 2.7 source code:

```bash
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.18/Python-2.7.18.tgz
```

#### 5.2. Extract the Source Code

Extract the downloaded tarball:

```bash
tar -xvf Python-2.7.18.tgz
```

#### 5.3. Move to the Python Directory

Change into the newly created Python directory:

```bash
cd Python-2.7.18
```

#### 5.4. Configure the Installation

Run the configure script with the `--prefix` option to specify the installation directory:

```bash
./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local
```

#### 5.5. Build and Install Python 2.7

Compile and install Python 2.7 with:

```bash
make
make install
```

### 6. Add Python 2.7 to Your PATH

To make Python 2.7 accessible from the command line, add it to your PATH by running:

```bash
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
```

### 7. Reload Your Profile

Apply the changes to your current session:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

### 8. Check Installations

Verify the installations by checking the versions:

```bash
python2.7 --version
python3 --version  # This will point to Python 3.12.9 in the active Conda environment.
```

## Additional Notes
- The `.local` directory is used as an example; you can choose a different directory if preferred.
- To switch between Python versions, activate the Conda environment using `conda activate swifttcr` for Python 3.12.9 and use `python2.7` for Python 2.
- Ensure you deactivate your Conda environment when you're done working by running:

```bash
conda deactivate
```
